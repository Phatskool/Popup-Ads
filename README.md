# Popup Ads
While looking for a script that handles a POP-UP window suitable for ads, i noticed that most of the "plugins" i came accross include a blackout background, not good if you wish to integrate a subtle approach that does not degrade user experience (as much as possible).
So i decided to make a new script that gives you the ability to load ads:(vids/pics) on the bottom left corner of your website(easily customisable)
I integrated a cookie function (default set to once per day | 1/24)
The default version features an html5 video with custom controls and css.
